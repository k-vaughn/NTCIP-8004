# NTCIP Structure of Management Information (SMI) \[Normative\] {.annex}

Annex A defines the overall structure of the NTCIP-defined management
information and several textual conventions that are believed to be
useful for a broad range of applications. The text provided in Annex A.1
constitutes the standard NTCIP8004-NemaV1 MIB. Annex A.2 (except the
headings) constitutes the standard NTCIP8004-TransportationV1 MIB.

## NEMA Module {.annex}

The `NTCIP8004-Transportation` module is shown below and is available on [GitHub](../mibs/NTCIP8004-NEMA.mib).

  DESCRIPTION "The experimental subtree is used to identify object types used

    is challenging due to an installed base. Thus, this node should only be 
    used for experiments, such as research efforts that are strictly limited 
    to be short-term projects to investigate and test ideas. More permanent 
    node assignments should be obtained prior to any longer-term or larger-
    scale deployment to prevent complications if, and when, the solution 
    becomes more widely adopted."

nemaPrivate             OBJECT-IDENTITY
  STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
"The private subtree is used to identify object types defined unilaterally. NEMA assigns nodes to enterprises for purposes such as defining enterprise-specific MIB modules. A request for a node assignment can be sent to the NTCIP Coordinator at ntcip@nema.org. When a sub-node is assigned, the responsibility for managing that sub-node is transferred to the enterprise making the request.

   Upon receiving a node, the enterprise may, for example, define new MIB modules and object types under this node. In addition, it is strongly recommended that the enterprise also register its transportation devices under this subtree, to provide an unambiguous identification mechanism for use in management protocols. For example, if the 'ABC, Inc.' enterprise produced transportation devices, then it could request a node under the nemaPrivate node from NEMA. Such a node might be numbered: 1.3.6.1.4.1.1206.3.99

   The 'ABC, Inc.' enterprise might then register their 'Widget Controller' under the name of 1.3.6.1.4.1.1206.3.99.1, ensuring a unique identification. Thereafter, each enterprise is responsible for ensuring unique identification of information objects within their subtree. NEMA delegates the role of assigning numbers under each nemaPrivate node to those to which they are assigned, except of course for the initial enterprise number."

NtcipRowStatusStatic   ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
  STATUS       deprecated
  DESCRIPTION  
    "<Definition>RowStatusStatic has four states and two commands associated 
     with it. 
     <Format> The four possible states are defined as:
     1) other: The status is controlled or defined by a user- or 
          manufacturer-specific object.
     2) standby: All columnar data in the row have passed (any) defined 
          consistency checks but are not to be used by the end application.
     3) available: All columnar data in the row have passed (any) defined
          consistency checks and are available to be used by the end 
          application.
     4) invalid: One or more columnar objects has a value that caused the 
          row to fail at least one defined consistency check. 

     Setting RowStatusStatic equal to one of the above values shall return 
     an error (e.g., 'wrongValue' in SNMPv3).

     The only two possible command values that may be set by a management 
     application are: 
     5) activate: Makes the columnar data in the row available for use by 
          the end application.
     6) deactivate: Makes the columnar data in the row unavailable for use 
          by the end application.

     <Informative> In a static table, all rows exist irrespective of whether 
     the columnar objects contain appropriate values. The value of a 
     columnar object within a row may be inappropriate when the values of 
     other columnar objects in the row are considered. An entire row itself 
     may also be considered inappropriate under some circumstances. If this 
     is the case, a static table shall include an additional columnar object 
     that defines row status and has the SYNTAX of RowStatusStatic. 

     UML state transition diagrams for RowStatusStatic are defined in NTCIP 
     8004.

     RowStatusStatic was deprecated in NTCIP8004v03.01 in favor of RowStatus, 
     which allows implementations to create rows when needed and to destroy 
     them when not needed. This allows the potential for better memory 
     management in implementations that wish to provide this capability."

NtcipIntegerBitmap31   ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
  DISPLAY-HINT "x"
  STATUS       deprecated
  DESCRIPTION  
   "<Definition>A bitmap of up to 31 bits with Bit 0 in the low-order bit of 
      the trailing octet. 
    <Informative>This has been deprecated in favor of the SNMP-standard BITS 
      construct, which orders the bits in the reverse order and allows for 
      growth in a bit field. Prior versions of NTCIP sometimes indicated a 
      value for Bit 31 (i.e., the high-order bit) with an unsigned range on 
      INTEGER; this was a technically invalid definition and resulted in 
      ambiguities as to whether it should be encoded in 4 octets (which is 
      technically a signed value, or 5 octets, which many off-the-shelf SNMP 
      engines do not support. As a result, implementation response to a value 
      that uses Bit 31 is undefined and should be avoided."

NtcipOwnerString   ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
  DISPLAY-HINT "127t"
  STATUS       deprecated
  DESCRIPTION  
   "<Definition>This data type is used to model an administratively assigned 
      name of the owner of a resource, preferably in human-readable form.
      The string is encoded in UTF-8. It is suggested that this name contain
      one or more of the following: management station name, manager’s name,
      location or phone number.
    <Informative> Versions prior to 2023 limited this textual convention to 
      the NVT ASCII character set; however, the range was expanded to allow 
      for more language support and UTF-8 is fully compatible with NVT
      ASCII. This textual convention has been deprecated as there is seldom a
      need to force a limit of 127 characters (as this convention does)
      rather than 255 characters (as SnmpAdminString does). "
